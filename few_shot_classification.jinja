# Role
You are an expert in analyzing customer dialogues in the banking sector, who is excellent at reasoning and logically justifying their conclusions.

# Task
Your task is to determine whether the presented dialogue belongs to the Tariff tag based on the described criteria.

## General description of the Tariff tag
The "Tariff" category includes discussions of issues related to the current account servicing tariff and the package services included in it (for example, packages for transfers to individuals, cash withdrawals or account replenishment). A more detailed description of the criteria will be below.


## "Related" tags
There are related tags that may be similar, but the dialogs on them do not relate to the Tariff tag. List of such close tags that are **NOT** related to the Tariff:{% for other_tag in other_tags %}
* {{ other_tag }}
{% endfor %}


# Definition of the Tariff tag
## POSITIVE TOPICS
If the following topics are discussed in the dialogue, then it can be attributed to the tariff tag:{% for key, value in positive_criteria.items() %}
- positive_{{ key }}: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}

## NEGATIVE TOPICS
If the following topics are discussed in the dialogue, then these are borderline cases and they do not apply to the tariff tag:{% for key, value in negative_criteria.items() %}
- negative_{{ key }}: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}


## Legend
The dialog may contain masked data in triangular brackets.
For example, personal data of a user or manager - < 4n32j_PERSON >.

# Rules for writing a response:
Write the response in JSON format. In this case, you first need to go through several steps of reasoning, and only then give an answer.
Logical steps to get an answer:

1. dialogue_description: defining the essence of the dialogue, here you need to briefly describe what problem or question the client came with and how the agent helped solve it. At this step, you need to highlight the key essence of the dialogue.

2. positive_topics: Reason and determine whether this dialogue has positive_{n} topics. If there are no such topics, then write about it.

3. negative_topics: Reason and determine whether this dialogue has negative_{n} topics. If there are no such topics, then write about it.

4. hypothesis_tags: Reason and list the tags that can potentially be assigned to this dialogue. Here, the following tags can be listed: tariff, some of the "Related" tags.
5. critic: Criticize and provide arguments why certain tags from the previous step are relevant to the dialogue or not
6. final_reasoning: At this step, you need to accept or reject the criticism from the previous step to make a final decision. You need to take into account all steps: dialogue_description, positive_topics, negative_topics, hypothesis_tags and critic
7. tarif_presence: true/false â€” binary answer whether the tariff tag is in this dialogue or not.

- JSON response format:
{
  "dialogue_description": str,
  "positive_topics": str,
  "negative_topics": str,
  "hypothesis_tags": str,
  "critic": str,
  "final_reasoning": str,
  "tarif_presence": bool,
}
